## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for looking here :)

I present my second version of a coded page using a free project using the Figma tool.
I tried to work out even the smallest details such as the Submit validation example without using RegExp - I think it came out at a very good level. For the creation of this site were used "basic" languages such as HTML, SCSS and JS.

I modeled after a project available for free which was designed in figma ;)
